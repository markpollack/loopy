/**
 * Callback interface for receiving events from an agent during execution.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface enables TUI and other clients to observe agent behavior without
 * depending on Spring AI internals. Implementations receive notifications about agent
 * state changes, tool calls, and can respond to questions.
 *
 * <p>
 * All methods have default no-op implementations, allowing clients to override only the
 * callbacks they need.
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Implementations should be thread-safe as callbacks may
 * be invoked from different threads during agent execution.
